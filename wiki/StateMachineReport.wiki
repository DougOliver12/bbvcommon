#summary Describes the state machine report.
#labels StateMachine

You can request a report of the state machine. 

This report contains:
  * state machine name
  * initial state
  * all states, with initial sub states, history mode and whether they have entry- and exit-actions
  * all transitions per state, with information whether they have a guard and how many actions are defined.

You can use this report to check your implementation.

See [StateMachineSample Sample] for a sample report.
