#summary Describes the state machine report.
#labels StateMachine

You can request a report of the state machine. This report contains the states, transitions, guards and actions (depends on the report generator used).

You can use this report to check your implementation.

Out of the box, there is a report generator for csv files, graphml files that can be layout with yEd and a textual report.

See [StateMachineSample Sample] for sample reports.

You can add your custom report by implementing a `IStateMachineReport`.
