bbv.Common consists of several mostly independent components developed at [http://www.bbv.ch bbv Software Services AG]:

The project is split into three sub-projects
  * bbv.Common - the main components
  * bbv.Common Contrib - new or contributed components
  * bbv.Common Obsolete - old components not maintained actively anymore

= bbv.Common =

== Events ==

EventBroker
 Notification component for synchronous and asynchronous loosly coupled notification with automatic thread switching

generic event arguments
 `EventArgs<YourTypeGoesHere>`

EventFilter
 Event filter to aggregate and delay frequently occurring events (e.g. file changes) 

== Hierarchical State Machine ==
StateMachine
 Hierarchical state machine with fluent definition syntax (active or passive)

== Asynchronous Operations ==
AsyncResult
 Implementation for IAsyncResult to execute asynchonous operations.

AsyncWorker
 Extends BackgroundWorker with exception handling that does not swallow exception and simpler usage within code.

AsyncModule
 Provide an easy way to a multithreaded application. Arbitrary objects can be extended with one or more worker threads and message queues to perform asynchronous tasks.

UserInterfaceThreadSynchronizer
 Simple to use thread switcher to execute operations synchronously or asynchronously on user interface thread (WinForms, WPF and ASP.NET)

== Evaluation Engine / Rule Engine ==
EvaluationEngine
 Foundation for evaluations (rules, validations, computations, ...): Single entry point for evaluations, loosely coupled, strict separation between questioner and solution definition.

Rule Engine (obsolete, replaced with EvalutionEngine)
 Foundation for evaluating rules: Single entry point for checking rules, Loosely coupled, Context based rule sets.

== Test Utilities ==
EventTester / EventTestList
 Simplifies testing of event invocations (automatic registration and deregistration, invocation count test, ...) ||

Log4NetHelper 
 Test log messages generated using log4net.

== csv ==
CsvParser / CsvWriter
 Parser and Writer for .csv (comma separated values) files.

== IO ==
TextFileReader / TextFileWriter
 Wrapper for files access to enable unit testing

TemporaryFileHolder
 Manages temporarily needed files (automatic deletion on dispose)

FileActionCommand
 Execute commands recursively on the file system: Get all files, move files, number of folders and files, extensible with custom commands.

FileSystemHelper / DriveUtilities
 Provides information about the file system and drives.

== Streams ==
StreamHelper
 Provides functionality for manipulating streams (copy and compare).

StreamLoggerStream / StreamDecoratorStream
 Stream decorators for logging or generic use.

== Miscellaneous ==
ApplicationHelper
 Provides functionality to check whether application is already running and optionally switch to running instance.

WindowsHelper
 Provides shutdown and logoff functionality.

HighResolutionStopWatch
 StopWatch that uses processor ticks for high resolution timing.

FormatHelper
 String.Format replacement that does not crash if too few arguments are defined but returns an error string.

StringTruncationFormatter
 Format provider for formatting string with a maximal length.

Resources 
 Resource loaders to load data from file system or embedded resources.

HashService
 Provides MD5 and SHA1 hashing.
