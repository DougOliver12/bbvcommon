#summary Shows the basic usage of the Distributed Event Broker

== Setup of the distributed event broker ==
The usage of the distributed event broker is astonishingly simple when you have prepared your transport layer. Basically it is only two lines of code.
{{{
// Use existing event broker or create special one for distributed events
var eventBroker = new EventBroker();

// Use extension method AddDistributedExtension
var distributedEventBrokerExtension = // new TechnologySpecificDistributedEventBrokerExtension
eventBroker.AddDistributedExtension(distributedEventBrokerExtension);
}}}
