#summary Shows the basic usage of the Bootstrapper

= Introduction =
To get started with the bootstrapper you need the following three things:
 # Extension interface
 # Strategy
 # Bootstrapper setup
== Extension interface ==
The extension interface defines the extension points which are called by the bootstrapper. The custom extension interface must inherit from `IExtension`. A very basic extension interface could look like the following:

{{{
    public interface ICustomExtension : IExtension
    {
        void Start();
        void Stop();
    }
}}}
The extension interface above would indicate that the applications extension points are:
 * Start
 * Stop
That's basically it for the extension interface. Although we generally advice to build a base class which defines virtual members for the extension points. For example:

{{{
    public abstract class CustomExtensionBase : ICustomExtension
    {
        public string Name
        {
            get { return this.GetType().FullNameToString(); }
        }

        public virtual void Start() { }
        public virtual void Shutdown() { }
        public abstract string Describe();
    }
}}}
This allows inheritors to override only the extension points that they are interested in.
