#summary Overview of the bbv.Common.StateMachine - a hierarchical state machine with fluent definition syntax
#labels Featured,StateMachine

== Features ==
  * value type based (enums, ints, ...) resulting in single class state machines.
  * actions
    * on transitions
    * entry and exit actions
  * transaction guards
  * hierarchical
    * different history behaviours to initialize state always to same state or last active state
  * fluent definition interface
  * synchronous/asynchronous state machine
    * passive state machine handles state transitions synchronuously
    * active state machine handles state transitions asynchronously on the worker thread of the state machine
  * configurable thorough logging simplifies debugging using log4net
  * state machine report for textual description of state machine
