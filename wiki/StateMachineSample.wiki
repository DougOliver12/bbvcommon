This is a sample state machine

[http://bbvcommon.googlecode.com/svn/wikiFiles/StateMachine/ElevatorStateMachine.gif]

== Definition ==

{{{
var elevator = new PassiveStateMachine<States, Events>("Elevator");

elevator.DefineHierarchyOn(States.Healthy, States.OnFloor, HistoryType.Deep, States.OnFloor, States.Moving);
elevator.DefineHierarchyOn(States.Moving, States.MovingUp, HistoryType.Shallow, States.MovingUp, States.MovingDown);
elevator.DefineHierarchyOn(States.OnFloor, States.DoorClosed, HistoryType.None, States.DoorClosed, States.DoorOpen);

elevator.In(States.Healthy)
    .On(Events.ErrorOccured).Goto(States.Error);

elevator.In(States.Error)
    .On(Events.Reset).Goto(States.Healthy)
    .On(Events.ErrorOccured);

elevator.In(States.OnFloor)
    .ExecuteOnEntry(this.AnnounceFloor)
    .ExecuteOnExit(Beep, Beep)
    .On(Events.CloseDoor).Goto(States.DoorClosed)
    .On(Events.OpenDoor).Goto(States.DoorOpen)
    .On(Events.GoUp)
        .If(CheckOverload).Goto(States.MovingUp)
        .Otherwise().Execute(this.AnnounceOverload, Beep)
    .On(Events.GoDown)
        .If(CheckOverload).Goto(States.MovingDown)
        .Otherwise().Execute(this.AnnounceOverload);

elevator.In(States.Moving)
    .On(Events.Stop).Goto(States.OnFloor);

elevator.Initialize(States.OnFloor);
}}}

The above state machine uses these actions and guards:
{{{
private void AnnounceFloor()
{
    /* announce floor number */
}

private void AnnounceOverload()
{
    /* announce overload */
}

private void Beep()
{
    /* announce overload */
}

private bool CheckOverload()
{
    return whetherElevatorHasOverload;
}
}}}

== Run the State Machine ==

This is a small sample to show how to interact with the state machine:
{{{
// queue some events to be performed when state machine is started.
elevator.Fire(Events.ErrorOccured);
elevator.Fire(Events.Reset);
            
elevator.Start();

// these events are performed immediately
elevator.Fire(Events.OpenDoor);
elevator.Fire(Events.CloseDoor);
elevator.Fire(Events.GoUp);
elevator.Fire(Events.Stop);
elevator.Fire(Events.OpenDoor);

elevator.Stop();
}}}

== Log ==

If you add 

{{{
elevator.AddExtension(new Extensions.Log4NetExtension<States, Events>("Elevator"));
}}}

to the above code then these are the log messages (if all are enabled - see log4net documentation on how to configure log messages).

Note how the state exits and enters are logged, especially for hierarchical transitions.

{{{

You can write your own extension for different logging.

== Report ==

There exist 3 different state machines out of the box (you can add your own by implementing `IStateMachineReport`)

=== .graphml report that can be automatically layout with yEd ===

The picture on top of this page shows this type of report.

=== csv files for states and transitions ===



=== Textual State Machine Report `StateMachineReportGenerator` ===
